Infinite Ammo Plus is a quality-of-life mod that introduces a variety of endless ammunition pouches and quivers. 
These items allow you to carry infinite bullets, arrows, and other ammo types, freeing up inventory space and making combat smoother. 
Designed to support both vanilla and popular mods like Calamity, Infinite Ammo Plus aims to integrate seamlessly into your playthrough, with balanced crafting recipes and consistent behavior.

The inspiration was the modification of Endless Ammo Bags by UnVoicingCow:

I wrote the modification from 0, because the goal is to maximize and expand the amount of ammunition for my favorite class - the Ranger.

As of the first version, there is only a chlorophyll bullet pouch and all the bullets from Calamity, as well as an infinite backpack for Rocket III and an infinite slime tank.
